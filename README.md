## 📦 WP Update Manager – Disable All WordPress Updates with Full Control

**WP Update Manager** is the ultimate solution for disabling **WordPress core, plugin, and theme updates** — including automatic checks, cronjobs, and nag notifications. Whether you're managing a high-stability site, a client installation, or a customized environment, this plugin gives you **granular control** over update behavior without touching a single line of code.

### ✅ Why Use WP Update Manager?

By default, WordPress constantly checks for updates to the core, themes, and plugins. While this is useful for many sites, some scenarios demand **fixed, stable environments** — such as white-labeled projects, custom development, or legacy support.

WP Update Manager disables all update mechanisms and suppresses admin notices, giving you a **cleaner dashboard**, reduced load on admin pages, and zero unexpected updates.
